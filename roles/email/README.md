Role Name
=========

Basic configuration for email thingies.  Currently only postfix is configured,
and email works only inside University network.  The server smtp.helsinki.fi is
not trivially reachable outside.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - email
